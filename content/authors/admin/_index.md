I am a second-year PhD student at UMPA (ENS Lyon) and the Inria Scool team (formerly SequeL), supervised by [Aurélien Garivier](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/aurelien.garivier/www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/_agarivie/index.html)  and [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/). Prior to my PhD, I graduated from ENS Paris-Saclay and École Polytechnique.

My main research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Armed Bandits. In particular, I have worked on Pure Exploration problems, where the goal is to learn a "good" decision using minimal feedback/observations from the environment. I focus on designing theoretically-grounded algorithms with good empirical performance.

I am also interested in online learning, statistical minimax theory, differential privacy and machine learning in general.
